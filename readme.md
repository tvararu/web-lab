Homework that I've done for the web technologies lab, with a lot of comments. You can view the contents of this repo through Github Pages. Direct links:

`bower_components` isn't placed in `.gitignore` because explaining `npm` and how to run `bower install` from the terminal is probably a bit too much for newly minted webdevs.
